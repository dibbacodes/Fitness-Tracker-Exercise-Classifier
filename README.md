### Steps Involved

1. **File Exploration:** Begin exploring and processing the dataset using `make_dataset.py`.
2. **Understanding CSV Files:** Gain insights into the structure and content of CSV files (measurement, participant, exercise, intensity).
3. **Data Transformation:** Prepare data for supervised learning tasks and ensure proper formatting for modeling.

## Data Visualization

### Workflow

1. **Visualization Overview:** Implement a workflow to explore data patterns effectively.
2. **Plotting:** Visualize single columns, all exercises, and compare metrics (sets, reps, intensity).
3. **Advanced Plotting:** Use multi-axis plots to analyze combinations of sensor data and consolidate plots into one figure.

## Outlier Detection and Handling

1. **Identifying Outliers:** Define outliers and use methods like Boxplots with IQR, Chauvenetâ€™s Criterion, and LOF for detection.
2. **Time-Series Outliers:** Visualize outliers in time-series data for deeper analysis.
3. **Handling Outliers:** Develop functions to replace or mitigate outlier effects to ensure data quality.

## Feature Engineering

1. **Feature Extraction:** Extract meaningful attributes from raw sensor data.
2. **Missing Values:** Implement imputation techniques to manage missing data effectively.
3. **Abstraction Techniques:** Utilize temporal and frequency abstraction to capture essential patterns.

## Modeling and Evaluation

1. **Model Training:** Split data into training and test sets for model development.
2. **Feature Selection:** Use methods like forward feature selection to identify relevant features.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model parameters using grid search for improved performance.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate models using appropriate metrics and compare results across different datasets.

## Results and Discussion

- **Visualization of Findings:** Present visualized data patterns and insights derived from the analysis.
- **Benchmarking:** Establish benchmark results and evaluate model performance against these benchmarks.
- **Discussion:** Interpret results, discuss limitations, and suggest areas for further exploration or improvement.
