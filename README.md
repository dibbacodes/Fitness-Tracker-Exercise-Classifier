# Fitness Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize fitness data collected from various sensors. The dataset consists of CSV files containing measurements related to participants, exercises performed, and intensity levels. The goal is to perform comprehensive data processing, feature engineering, and modeling to derive insights and build predictive models.

## Setup and Environment

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python
- Conda

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Create Conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate your-env
   ```

### Steps Involved

1. **File Exploration:** Begin exploring and processing the dataset using `make_dataset.py`.
2. **Understanding CSV Files:** Gain insights into the structure and content of CSV files (measurement, participant, exercise, intensity).
3. **Data Transformation:** Prepare data for supervised learning tasks and ensure proper formatting for modeling.

## Data Visualization

### Workflow

1. **Visualization Overview:** Implement a workflow to explore data patterns effectively.
2. **Plotting:** Visualize single columns, all exercises, and compare metrics (sets, reps, intensity).
3. **Advanced Plotting:** Use multi-axis plots to analyze combinations of sensor data and consolidate plots into one figure.

## Outlier Detection and Handling

1. **Identifying Outliers:** Define outliers and use methods like Boxplots with IQR, Chauvenet’s Criterion, and LOF for detection.
2. **Time-Series Outliers:** Visualize outliers in time-series data for deeper analysis.
3. **Handling Outliers:** Develop functions to replace or mitigate outlier effects to ensure data quality.

## Feature Engineering

1. **Feature Extraction:** Extract meaningful attributes from raw sensor data.
2. **Missing Values:** Implement imputation techniques to manage missing data effectively.
3. **Abstraction Techniques:** Utilize temporal and frequency abstraction to capture essential patterns.

## Modeling and Evaluation

1. **Model Training:** Split data into training and test sets for model development.
2. **Feature Selection:** Use methods like forward feature selection to identify relevant features.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model parameters using grid search for improved performance.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate models using appropriate metrics and compare results across different datasets.

## Results and Discussion

- **Visualization of Findings:** Present visualized data patterns and insights derived from the analysis.
- **Benchmarking:** Establish benchmark results and evaluate model performance against these benchmarks.
- **Discussion:** Interpret results, discuss limitations, and suggest areas for further exploration or improvement.
